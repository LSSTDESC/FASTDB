## lsst namespaces

`lsst.v9_0.*` was copied directly from https://github.com/lsst/alert_packet/blob/main/python/lsst/alert/packet/schema/9/0/lsst.v9_0.alert.avsc

## fastdb namespaces

### fastdb_9_0_1

Based on `lsst.v9_0`.  Has only `BrokerMessage` in it, which includes things from the `lsstv9_0` namespace.

### fastdb_test_0.2

**This one is old and out of date, ignore it.**

`[namespace].Alert.avsc` is manually constructed

`[namespace].Dia*.avsc` were produced by the code in `src/admin` under repo root

`[namespace].BrokerMesssage.avsc is copied from Alert.avsc, but has the added "classifications" field
