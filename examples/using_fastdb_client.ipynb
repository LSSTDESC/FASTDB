    "# Using fastdb_client\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is for running in Perlmutter.  You may be able to easily convert it for somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this example notebook was built when `fastdb-rknop-dev.lbl.gov` had the ELAsTiCC2 data loaded into it.  It's possible at some later time that you will not get the same results.  When a more stable version of fastdb exists, I will update this example notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is fastdb_client\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a python program useful for connecting to instances of FASTDB.  At some level, it's just a wrapper around python `requests`, but it handles some other stuff you wouldn't want to handle manually.  For example, logging into FASTDB is not just a matter of sending a password over the net, but is a complicated handshaking of public key cryptography (created by somebody trying to be paranoid to make sure the password itself never needed to be sent over the network from your machine to the server machine).  The fastdb_client takes care of all of that for you.  It has the ability to do some format parsing of responses from the web server.  Finally, it has a built-in \"sleep and retry\" cycle, where if the connection to the FASTDB server fails for some reason (which does happen--- this is the Internet, after all), it will sleep a few seconds and retry, repeating that (by default) five times before giving up for good.  This can greatly increase the reliability of scripts that use the fastdb_client, saving you from having to implement your own error catching and retry loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting an account\n",
    "\n",
    "To use FASTDB, you need an account on the instance of the FASTDB web server you want to interact with.  As of this writing, the only one that exists is `https://fastdb-rknop-dev.lbl.gov`, and as its name suggests, it's a development server that may be down at any time, or that may have unexpected changes of contents and state at any time.  To get an account, ask Rob Knop (via Discovery Alliance Slack) for an account; I will need the username you want for the account, the name you want displayed when you are logged in, and the email address associated with the account.  Once I tell you the account is created, go to the webserver in your browser, and click on \"Request Password Reset\".  Put in your username, and click \"Email Password Resent Link\".  Shortly thereafter, in your email you should find a message with a link to click on to reset your password.  (When your account is first created, it does not have a password; you can not log into it until you set one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to choose a <a href=\"http://rknop.net/password.html\">good password</a>.  FASTDB is currently not using any TFA, and I'm really hoping we won't feel the need to go that way, as that will make a lot of life a lot more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up a convenience initialization file\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always just use the url, username, and password every time you connect to fastdb.  However, it will probably make your life easier if you create a file `.fastdb.ini` (notice the period at the beginning) in your home directory.  This file will have contents like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[rknop-dev]\n",
    "url = https://fastdb-rknop-dev.lbl.gov\n",
    "username = <your username>\n",
    "password = <your password>\n",
    "\n",
    "[production]\n",
    "url = https://desc-fastdb.lbl.gov\n",
    "username = <your username>\n",
    "password = <your password>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each block of lines starting with a line in brackets represents one FASTDB server you might want to connect to.  The name in brackets can be whatever you want; it will be wha tyou use in order to specify the server you want to conenct to.  Below each bracketed line, you need three lines, similar to the example above, which specify the URL of the web server, your username on that server, and your password on that server.  (As of this writing you do not want to include the `[production]` block because that server does not exist.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: the fastdb client will refuse to use this `.ini` file if it's permissions aren't sufficiently paranoid.  After you've created the file, run\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd\n",
    "chmod go -rwx .fastdb.ini\n",
    "```\n",
    "to make sure that only you can read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually a number of other configuration options you can specify here, but for now they're not that important.  Talk to Rob, or read the `fastdb_client.py` source code if you're interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, before long, the necessary python libraries will be in the desc `td_env` environment.  The FASTDB client requires that `pycryptodome` be installed (which, if you're building your own environment, is a simple matter of `pip install pycryptodome`), but as of this writing it's not in `td_env`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running from the command line, you can get a minimal environment that has what you need to run `fastdb` by running\n",
    "```\n",
    "source /global/cfs/cdirs/lsst/groups/TD/SOFTWARE/fastdb_deployment/fastdb_client_venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, later, just run `deactivate` to leave the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running from jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point in the future, you will be able to just the `desc-td` kernel.  But, as of this writing, that kernel doesn't have the necessary `pycryptodome` libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set yourself up, on perlmutter, run\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd\n",
    "mkdir -p .local/share/jupyter/kernels/fastdb-client\n",
    "cd .local/share/jupyter/kernels/fastdb-client\n",
    "```\n",
    "once you're in that directory (which the last `cd` command did), create a text file `kernel.json` with the following contents:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"argv\": [\n",
    "    \"/global/cfs/cdirs/desc-td/SOFTWARE/fastdb_deployment/fastdb_client_venv/fastdb_client-env.sh\",\n",
    "    \"-f\",\n",
    "    \"{connection_file}\"\n",
    "  ],\n",
    "  \"display_name\": \"fastdb-client-env\",\n",
    "  \"language\": \"python\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thereafter, if you log into Perlmutter's Jupyter hub, you should be able to start a notebook that uses the `fastdb-client-env` kernel.  This example script was run within that kernel."

    "## Direct SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make make direct read-only queries to the PostgreSQL database behind the FASDTB webserver.  You construct queries and substitution dictionaries just like you'd send to `psycopg2`'s `cursor.execute` method.  (Use the `%(name)s` format for substitutions in your query, *not* the simple `%s` format where you'd pass a list as the second argument of `cursor.execute.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two interfaces.  The \"short\" query interface is for queries that will complete in less than five minutes.  (This is actually not a database restriction, but a restriction of the web proxy in front of the FASTDB web server; it will time any connection out after five minutes.)  The \"long\" query interface is for longer queries.  It normally has a cycle of submitting a query, repeatingly checking to see if it's done, and then asking for the results.  However, the fastdb_client has a function that wraps all of that into one call that's as simple to use as the short SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both interfaces, you can either pass a single query, or a list of queries.  If you pass a list of queries, you will only get the results from the *last* query.  If you want the results of multiple queries, send them each in individually.  The purpose of allowing multiple queries is so that you can play games with temporary tables and such while doing a complicated query.  If you past a list of queries, then you must also pass a list of substitution dictionaries that has the same length as your query list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using either interface requires you to understand the structures of the tables.  In particular, you need to undertand about `processing_version` and `snapshot`.  If you do not, and just look at columns in the `diaobject` and `diasource` tables, there is an excellent chance you will not get what you think you are getting.  See ROB PUT IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU DOCUMENT THE DATABASE SCHEMA AND STRUCTURE."

    "### The long query interface\n",
    "\n",
    "If your query is going to take more than 5 minutes, a call to `submit_short_sql_query` will time out.  (The backend database server will actually still be performing your query, but the web proxy will time out.)  FASTDB also has a system whereby you can submit a query (or a sequence of queries) to be run, but instead of the results, you get back a query id.  A job running on the backend server keeps track of which of these \"long queries\" have been submitted, and submits them in order, saving the results.  (The backend run several processes, so it can work on a handful of long queries at once.)  The normal way of using this long query interface is through the following methods of FASTDBClient:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `submit_long_sql_query` : send the query and substitution dictionary (or queries and substitution dictionaries, if you want to send a sequence of queries and only get the results from the last one).  Get back an opaque string (called the \"query id\") that you will use to identify this query.\n",
    "* `check_long_sql_query` : send the query id, get back a response from the server that tells you the state of the query.  It will tell you if the query is still queued, if it has started, if it errored out, or if it has finished.\n",
    "* `get_long_sql_query_result` : only call this once `check_long_sql_query` tells you the query is finished.  Send the query id, get back the results.  The format of the results depends on the `return_format `parameter you passed to `submit_long_sql_query`.  Right now, only `return_format='csv'` is supported.  You will get back a string that is the contents of a CSV file with your query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the dockstrings in `fastdb_client.py` for more information about using this interface.  Normally, you would save the returned query id somewhere, and every so often run a new script that sends that query id and looks for results.  However, there's an easier interface that works in a manner very similar to `submit_short_sql_query`, it just takes longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An easier (but, of course, less flexible) way\n",
    "\n",
    "The FASTDBClient method `synchronous_long_sql_query` will take care of all the calls above.  You call it with your query or queries, wait a long time, and get the results back.  In addition to the first two arguments (which are the query and substitution dictionary), you can pass a `return_format` (which defaults to `csv`, which is currently the only thing installed).  Two more parameters, `checkeach` (defaults to 300) and `maxwait` (defaults to 3600) tell it how often to check if your query is finished.  `checkeach` is the number of seconds to wait between checking if your query is finished.  It won't even check the first time before this much time has elapsed, so you know your call to `synchronous_long_sql_query` will take at least this long.  Please do not set `checkeach` to anything less than (say) 30 seconds.  (Indeed, if you're setting it to less than 300 seconds, there's an excellent chance you could just use the short sql query interface.)  After waiting `maxwait` seconds, it will give up altogether.  The reason to set this is if (for instance) the backend query runner has crashed; in that case, your query will languish in 'queuing mode' forever.  If you have confidence that the backend is working right, you can set `maxwait` to something huge, and eventually you will get back either the results of your query, or an execption will be raised if the query errored out."
