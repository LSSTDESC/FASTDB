# FASTDB
Development of the Fast Access to Survey Transients Database (FASTDB) 

This repository is for the development of the Fast Access to Survey Transients Database (FASTDB) for use by the Time Domain Working group.

It will contain light-curve data for supernova-like transients (SN1a, SNCC, SLSB,...) and fast and rare transients (KN, TDE, FBOTS,...)
