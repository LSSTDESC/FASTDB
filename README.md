TODO: get this set up on readthedocs

In the mean time, to read the documentation, check out this git archive.  Make sure you have [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) installed on your system.  cd into the `docs` subdirectory of your checkout and run
```
make html
```

Then, point your web browser at:
```
file:///path/to/checkout/docs/_build/html/index.html
```
replacing `/path/to/checkout` with the absolute path of your git checkout.
